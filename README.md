Furniture Store

Introduction

This project is a web-based furniture design application developed for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) module. It aims to assist furniture store designers in creating customized room layouts based on individual customer needs.
The core problem addressed by this application is helping customers visualize how furniture will look in their own homes before making a purchase. By offering interactive tools and realistic rendering, the platform bridges the gap between imagination and decision-making.
